    <p>Being Albanian is Like a Gift from God . An advanced super race, with their own language, customs, culture, traditions and a rich history. A people who stand strong in the face of imperialism and Western European stupidity. Strong economy, strong army, strong nation, the proud ShqipÃ«tar stands armed and ready to defend his pure nation from the wraths of "humans", Greeks, Serbs, Turks, and other horrendous, animalistic, hordes. Oh how I thank God that I was born a handsome, tall, perfect Gheg Albanian warrior.  With dual histories, one from the great Ottoman warriors, discoverers, inventors, and intellectuals and another from the grandeur of the Byzantine masters of Eastern Europe I can proudly stand tall and say I am proud to be Albanian, and I will love my land until the very last day.  Long live Albania.</p>
